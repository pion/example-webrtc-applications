# sfu-ws

sfu-ws is a many-to-many websocket based SFU. This is a more advanced version of [broadcast](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/tree/master/examples/broadcast)
and demonstrates the following features.

* Trickle ICE
* Re-negotiation
* Basic RTCP
* Multiple inbound/outbound tracks per PeerConnection
* No codec restriction per call. You can have H264 and VP8 in the same conference.
* Support for multiple browsers

We also provide a flutter client that supports the following platforms

* Android, iOS
* Web
* MacOS (Windows, Linux and Fuschia in the [future](https://github.com/flutter-webrtc/flutter-webrtc#functionality))

For a production application you should also explore [simulcast](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/tree/master/examples/simulcast),
metrics and robust error handling.
